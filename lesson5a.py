# PYTHON FUNCTIONS.
# They are a block of code/statements that performs a given task/action. They can be reused through out the program to perform different tasks.
# Functions are defined using the def keyword. (define)
# We have two main types of functions i.e ;
# 1. In-built functions -> They come pre-installed with the interpreter i.e, print(), pop(), range(), append(), etc..
# 2. User defined functions => They are created ny the programmer to solve a given task.
# To define a function you need to give it a name followed by parenthesis.
# For the function body it is usually indented and to invoke a function we use the function name.

    print("Hello, how are you?")


# Below  we call the function by use of its name.
